"""Encode and decode functions for the noise codec.

This codec serves as a wrapper for the standard LSB codec, but instead
of requiring a source image, it encodes your message inside a file containing
random noise.

With regular images, anyone with the original (non-encoded) image can compare
the before and after images to find the difference and decode the message by seeing
exactly which bits were changed. This is easy to do with many digital files stored
on the web. However, with random noise, there is absolutely no indication that the file
was changed, as there is no original image to compare it to.
